## ðŸ“˜ Overview

**COSC 236** introduces the principles and practices of **Object-Oriented (OO) systems analysis and design**.  
Students learn to apply **UML modeling**, **use cases**, and **OO design patterns** to create robust, maintainable software solutions.  
Throughout the labs, we focus on:

- Identifying system requirements and translating them into object models
- Designing classes, relationships, and behaviors using UML diagrams
- Implementing and testing Java applications that reflect good OO design principles
